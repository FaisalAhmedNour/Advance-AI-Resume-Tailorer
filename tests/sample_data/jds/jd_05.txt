Senior Machine Learning Engineer — AI Products
Location: Boston, MA (Hybrid)
Type: Full-time

About the Role:
We are building AI-first healthcare software that helps clinicians reduce administrative burden. We're looking for a Senior ML Engineer to take our models from prototype to scalable production systems.

Responsibilities:
- Design, train, and deploy large language models (LLMs) and transformer-based NLP models for clinical text.
- Build and maintain MLOps pipelines for model lifecycle management (training, evaluation, versioning, serving).
- Optimize model inference latency and throughput using quantization, ONNX, and TensorRT.
- Collaborate with clinical experts to design evaluation benchmarks and annotation pipelines.
- Implement privacy-preserving ML techniques (federated learning, differential privacy).
- Publish internal research reports and stay current with ML literature.

Required Skills:
- 4+ years of ML engineering experience (industry or research).
- Expert in PyTorch or TensorFlow; experience fine-tuning transformer models (BERT, GPT).
- Hands-on MLOps: MLflow, Kubeflow, or similar experiment tracking / model serving platforms.
- Proficiency in Python; experience with FastAPI or similar for model serving APIs.
- Understanding of model optimization: quantization, distillation, ONNX, TensorRT.

Preferred Skills:
- Experience with HuggingFace Transformers and PEFT/LoRA fine-tuning.
- Knowledge of AWS SageMaker or Vertex AI.
- Healthcare domain experience (HIPAA, clinical NLP).

Soft Skills:
- Research mindset with pragmatic engineering execution.
- Strong written communication (papers, technical reports).
- Comfortable working across clinical and engineering teams.
